I was in beautiful Barcelona for [ElixirConf.EU][ElixirConf.EU-2017] 2017.  
In this post I'm sharing some of my notes and impressions about it.

## Tutorials

I attended the tutorial "Microservices under the Umbrella" by [Makis Otman][Profile-Makis-Otman] &
[Georgina McFadyen][Profile-Georgina-McFadyen], both working for [8th Light][8th-Light].

We hacked on code from the following repositories:

* https://github.com/Maikon/elixir_setup
* https://github.com/Maikon/pharos

The was goal to create an umbrella application, going through the pros
and cons of such an architecture. We coded a sub-application to query
the Wikipedia API and cache the results to a GenServer. We wrote tests
and finally used [:rpc.call/4][rpc-call] to call functions on a remote node.

## Conference - Day 1

### Keynote - [JosÃ© Valim][Profile-Jose-Valim]

The presentation was about the beginnings of the language, the current state of development and
what to expect in upcoming releases.

#### Highlights

Depression Valley
: The point where no-one is using your language and you're unsure you're
headed in the right direction. 

Lego Lang
: That was the original name of the language in the early days.

Rookie Mistakes
: JosÃ© said that he made some during the first stages of development.

JosÃ© stated that he knew the features he wanted to include in the
language, the difficult part was to shape it in a way to make people
productive. Early on, too much `eval` was required to make something
non-trivial.

### A Tour of the Elixir Source Code - [Xavier Noria][Profile-Xavier-Noria]

In this talk Xavier demystified parts of the Elixir compiler.
How code is loaded and compiled, Macros and the AST.

Topics:

* Elixir Project Structure
* What is Elixir written in?
* Compilation
* Parallel Compiler
* Implementation of Protocols

Some little-known facts:

* The Elixir compiler wraps your code in a top-level module.

### Ecto - DBConnection - Ecto's SQL Sandbox - [fishcakez][Profile-John-Fish] (aka John Fish)

Stories behind the implementation of [Ecto SQL Sandbox][Ecto.Adapters.SQL.Sandbox], which is a way
to have concurrent tests against the database.

Highlights

* Using process dictionaries is considered a bad practice but it's fine in
a few occasions. See [example][process-dicts]
* He talked about [Binary Efficiency Guide][Binary-Efficiency-Guide]
* Ecto can't optimise insert queries (probably related to [ecto#179][Ecto-Issues-179])
* Upcoming Ecto@2.2 [Ecto.Adapters.SQL.Stage][Ecto.Adapters.SQL.Stage]

### Machine Learning with Elixir and Phoenix - [Eric Weinstein][Profile-Eric-Weinstein]

The talk was about implementing a neural network on stock market data to predict
prices and act upon them.

* Machine Learning on the BEAM is fun practical and super doable
* I think he used the [neat_ex][neat_ex] package for the neural networks

Little or no code was shown during the talk and I couldn't find the
source in one of Erics' GitHub [repositories][weinstein-repos].


---------------------

## Conference - Day 2

### Always Available - [Claudio Ortolina][Profile-Claudio-Ortolina]

[Slides][Slides-Claudio-Ortolina]

* Use one process per request
* Prevent letting the application to go down, when the database goes down
* Elixir > v1.4 [local registry][registry] can be used to register workers
* Hide implementation details, typespecs can be of help, see example:

```elixir
defmodule Libra.Inspector do
 @type url :: String.t
 @type uuid :: String.t
 @spec process_url(url) :: {:ok, uuid} | {:error, term}
 @spec get_page(uuid) :: {:ok, Libra.Page.t} | {:error, :not_found}
end
```

### GraphQL in Practice - [Bruce Williams][Profile-Bruce-Williams] & [Benjamin Wilson][Profile-Ben-Wilson]

The talk was about using [Absinthe][absinthe-graphql], a GraphQL library
for Elixir.

> GraphQL is not just a frontend technology

* Has an active growing [community][graphql-community] with more than 500 slack members
* A [book][book-graphql-elixir]'s coming soon from the pragmatic programmers
* Absinthe has a way to prevent DoS by complex queries. It performs
  complexity analysis of a query (it even provides a way to supply you own
  algorithm/implementation) and does not execute queries above a
  configurable threshold.

### Closing Keynote - [Chris McCord][Profile-Chris-McCord]

* Open-source is hard. You have to handle all sorts of feedback
* Contexts are application barriers
* Goal of Phoenix@1.2: Distributed applications
* Goal of Phoenix@1.3: Design with intent. You have to think design carefully
* Goal of Phoenix@1.4: Convincing the stakeholders
  - Monitoring & Metrics
  - Health Checks
  - Robust applications in production
  - Insights into running apps
  - "ROFLSCALE" apps

* There are a few agents for [APM][APM] services that can affect the performance of a running app.

Chris announced that there will be a common interface for metric collection. Probably implemented
as a standalone library. Read more [here][phoenix-metrics].

He demoed an [phoenix][phoenix] application feeding gauges in realtime with application metrics. A candidate abstraction
for metrics reporting is the following:

```elixir
defmodule Demo.Metrics do
  import Metrics

  def start_link do
    Metrics.Supervisor.start_link(__MODULE__, [
      gauge(:memory,     every: [1, :second]),
      gauge(:cpu,        every: [1, :second]),
      gauge(:processes,  every: [1, :second]),
      gauge(:memory,     every: [1, :second])
    ])
  end

  ## Gauges

  def memory(state) do
    {:ok, :memsup.get_system_memory_data(), state}
  end

  def cpu(state) do
    {:ok, %{usage: :cpu_sup.util()}, state}
  end
end
```

It's going to be part of the roadmap for [Kitto][kitto] to make it easy to have a dashboard for phoenix metrics, maybe in the
looks of [https://kitto.io/dashboards/jobs][kitto-jobs]

* There were at least 2 reported laptop thefts, which got me worried
* No water/coffee between the talks
* I had a really interesting discussion with Xavier Noria about handling
  money with Elixir. It seems like the ecosystem needs something like [RubyMoney][RubyMoney].
* I tried [black pudding tapas][black-pudding-tapas]. Unforgettably horrible ðŸ¤¢.
* I competed in the [ElixirCards][elixircards] tournament! I couldn't get past JosÃ© Valim though ðŸ˜€.
